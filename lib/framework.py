Cardputer App Framework
=======================

The framework is the core of the app system. It:
- Manages a list of installed apps
- Runs the main async event loop
- Polls the keyboard and routes input to the current app
- Handles ESC key to return to launcher

HOW IT WORKS:
-------------
1. main.py creates a Framework instance
2. Apps are installed via fw.install(app)
3. fw.start() begins the main event loop
4. The event loop polls keyboard every 10ms
5. Key events are routed to the current app's _kb_event_handler()
6. ESC always returns to the launcher

KEYBOARD HANDLING:
------------------
The framework uses MatrixKeyboard from the hardware module.
MatrixKeyboard auto-detects Cardputer vs Cardputer ADV hardware.

Each tick of the event loop:
1. kb.tick() - Poll keyboard hardware for new events
2. kb.is_pressed() - Check if a key was pressed
3. kb.get_key() - Get the key code
4. Route to current app's _kb_event_handler(event, fw)
5. If event not handled and key is ESC, return to launcher

USAGE:
------
    from lib.framework import Framework
    from apps.launcher import LauncherApp
    from apps.my_app import MyApp

    fw = Framework()
    launcher = LauncherApp()
    fw.install_launcher(launcher)
    fw.install(launcher)
    fw.install(MyApp())
    fw.start()  # Blocks forever
